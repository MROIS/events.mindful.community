The annual Mindfulness Community of Puget Sound (MCPS) retreat is held at beautiful Camp Indianola (Suquamish Land) guided by Dharma Teacher Kaira Jewel Lingo with the theme, Moving From Separation To Authentic Connection. 

We will be exploring how to cultivate true love to strengthen and bring greater fulfillment into all of your relationships, whether with yourself, loved ones, friends, in the workplace or wider community. We will learn practices that open the heart and help us to find and nurture the thread of connection that is always there between us and others, individually and collectively.

The retreat will take place from Monday March 25th to Sunday March 31st. On Monday afternoon, check-in opens at 2pm, program starts at 4pm.
