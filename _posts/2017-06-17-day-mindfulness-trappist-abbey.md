The Communities of Mindful Living in Oregon invite you to a Silent Day of Mindfulness in the tradition of Thich Nhat Hanh

“Healing Ourselves, Healing the World”

Thich Nhat Hanh (Thây) says a day of mindfulness can be the lever that will lift us to the habit of practicing mindfulness every hour and every moment. Everyone has the right to such a day, for without it “we will lose ourselves quickly in a life full of worry and action, and our responses will become increasingly useless.”

Please consider joining us for a day of silent mindfulness practice where we can experience the spaciousness of silence, and water the positive seeds of compassion, joy, love, and faith within us. As we practice stopping, calming and looking deeply within the atmosphere of peaceful silence at the Trappist Abbey in Lafayette, Oregon, we nourish our mindfulness and cultivate the capacity to heal the wounds within ourselves, our families, our communities, and the world. Both new and experienced practitioners are welcome!

We reserve one Friday each month (usually the third Friday) to practice at the Abbey.  If you are interested in coming please contact me, Denise Ségor, at <nisi.segor@mindful.community>.
