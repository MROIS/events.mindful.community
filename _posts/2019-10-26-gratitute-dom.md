## Dharma Teachers Sheila Canal & Nisi Ségor   


What does gratitude feel like?  How do we experience reverence for life?  In this season of giving thanks, the darkest and often difficult time of year, we give ourselves the time and space just to be. Through sitting, walking, deep relaxation, touching the earth and stillness, we will explore gratitude, reverence and resilience.
