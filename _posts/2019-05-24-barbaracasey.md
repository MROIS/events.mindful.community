### Lead by Dharma Teacher Barbara Casey

On this day together, we will explore awareness in many different flavors.

Through silence, resting and listening, we come to the essence of the moment, where we find that we already are what we need to be. As we share this precious experience of life as one community, as one body, joy and hope bloom within us.

Barbara Casey received lamp transmission from Thich Nhat Hanh in January of 2009 and is co-founder of the Peaceful Refuge Sangha. 

She moved to Gig Harbor, Washington, from her home in Ashland, Oregon 4 years ago. She enjoys living near the water and in the beauty of the Pacific Northwest. Her practice is to enjoy life and to share that joy with others. 

<strong>BRING a Sack Lunch</strong>. Tea and Snacks will be available. Some people like to bring a small lap blanket for relaxation. Please bring a notebook and pencil if you want to write during personal time.
