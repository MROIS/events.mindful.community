### A DAY OF MINDFULNESS in the tradition of Thich Nhat Hanh

Come enjoy the unique beauty of Trout Lake Abbey as we celebrate the Autumn Equinox in a
creative and mindful way. This retreat will balance silence and creative exploration to deepen our faith and trust in the dharma as we navigate challenging times.
  
Autumn Equinox is the day when the world comes into equilibrium and we prepare for harvest.

To hold the world together, knowing we cannot separate the light from the dark, we will strengthen
our equanimity, the inclusion of all things, by inviting in the Bodhisattvas, “Never Disparaging” and
“Great Aspiration”. Along with cultivating our meditation practice, the use of story and creative
processes, such as writing, soulcollage®, and ritual, will awaken our intuition and imagination. As a
community we can then weave together a vision for peacefully stepping forth, generously offering
our unique gifts to heal our precious planet. Together, we will sit, walk, eat and share, with gratitude for the fruits of our collective wisdom.
