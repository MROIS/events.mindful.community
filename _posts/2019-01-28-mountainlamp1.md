### led by Eileen Kiera

Eileen is an ecologist by training and a vegetable gardener by passion, but the practice and support of the Dharma has been her primary focus for the 30+ years. She received Lamp Transmission as a Dharma teacher in 1990 from the Ven. Thich Nhat Hanh and has spent the years since teaching the Dharma. Over the years she has led retreats in the U.S., Mexico, Europe, Canada and Australia. Her primary focus is in support of lay Dharma practice in the Pacific Northwest.

In order to facilitate practice and settle the mind, Sati Retreats at Mountain Lamp are conducted wholly in friendly noble silence. In addition to walking meditation outdoors, Dharma Talks, and communal meals, we have periods of sitting and indoor walking meditation throughout the day. On retreat, we commit to participating in the full schedule in order to support each other in practice.
